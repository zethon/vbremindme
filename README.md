### What is the point of RemindMe? 
RemindMeBot was made as a way to remind the user about a comment or thread for later use. Reminders will be sent you in a PM with a link to 
the referenced post or thead.

This is a clone of the same feature on Reddit. For more info: http://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/24duzp/remindmebot_info/
